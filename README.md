# OLYMPIC_DATA_ANALYTICS_AZURE

In this Azure-based project, I had made a simple data pipeline by extracting data from Kaggle i.e our source data, then ingesting raw data into Azure Gen2 Data Lake, again doing some basic transformation using Azure Databricks and then loading transformed data into another Azure Gen2 Data Lake and doing analysis in Azure Synapse Analytics as per requirements. All screeshots of flow chart and some basic analysis are uploaded in pdf file.
